# Cursor Rules for André Bellemare Project

## File Formatting Rules

**IMPORTANT**: After any file modification, ALWAYS remove trailing blank lines at the end of files.

- When editing any `.py` or `.html` file, ensure the file ends with exactly one newline character
- Remove all trailing blank lines (empty lines) at the end of files
- Do NOT trim trailing whitespace on lines that contain content (only remove completely empty lines)
- Files should end with a single newline, not multiple blank lines

## Code Style

- All comments must be in English
- All user-facing text and documentation should be in French
- Follow Django best practices
- Use type hints where appropriate

## File Organization

- Documentation files go in the `docs/` directory in the project root
- Keep templates organized in `templates/` with subdirectories for components, pages, and emails
